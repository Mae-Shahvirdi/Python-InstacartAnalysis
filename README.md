# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis

## Introduction
As an analyst for Instacart, an online grocery store operating through an app, your role is pivotal in uncovering deeper insights into the company's sales patterns. While Instacart boasts commendable sales figures, there's a desire to delve further into their data to extract actionable insights. Your task is to conduct an initial data analysis and exploration to uncover valuable insights and propose strategies for enhanced segmentation based on provided criteria.

## Context
The stakeholders at Instacart are keenly interested in understanding the diverse range of customers within their database and their respective purchasing behaviors. Recognizing the limitations of employing uniform marketing methods, they are contemplating a shift towards a targeted marketing approach. This entails tailoring marketing campaigns to different customer segments to evaluate their impact on product sales. Your analysis is expected to shed light on the potential contours of such a strategy, ensuring that Instacart effectively targets specific customer profiles with relevant products.

## Objective
The primary objective of your analysis is to inform the formulation of a targeted marketing strategy for Instacart. By leveraging insights derived from the data, you will delineate customer segments and their corresponding purchasing behaviors. These insights will serve as the foundation for crafting tailored marketing campaigns aimed at different customer profiles. Ultimately, the goal is to optimize Instacart's marketing efforts to resonate with diverse customer segments and drive increased sales of their products.

## Key Questions
The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
○ What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
○ Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
○ Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
○ Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
habits?
○ What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
○ What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer
profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.
